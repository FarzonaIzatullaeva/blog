            <p><strong>How I stated coding...</strong> <br> <br>
                When I was 11, me and my friends were really interested in computers. It turned out that one of my friends was already going to some academy to learn how to code. I asked him if he minds if I and my friends will go there too, and he did not mind. After a few days I told about this my friends and all of us registered to <strong>"Hello IT" </strong>. 
            </p>

            <p>We all started learning how to create websites, but the information that they taught was very basic. It was not enough for me and I started to do more research on academies that teach kids how to code. It was already Summer, and my mom found out that the university in our city offered <em>Scratch</em> courses for kids. I registered for it, started building basic games using <em>Scratch </em>.
     
   
            </p>

            <p>
                After this Summer, our middle school started to teach us <em>Unity</em>.  All of us were very excited, but this did not last too long, as our school was in quarantine. I remember that I stopped coding until the pandemic ended. Then when another Summer came, I started studying <em>Python</em> Programming language at <strong>"Bobir Akilkhanov Academy Napa Edy Hub"</strong>. Before I was only learning basic programming languages so when it came to learning <em>Python</em>, it was very hard. 

            </p>

            <p>By the time I was studying  <em>Python</em>, we got our visa to the United States! We moved there, and I stopped programming again for 5 months. After this, I asked my mom to buy me a set of courses from Mosh Hamedani as a New Year gift. I started doing one course by one, and still doing them nowadays. I received a couple of certificates and learned even more.</p>

            <p>When I was a sophomore in High School, I enrolled myself in INTRO to Programming. There we learned <em>HTML&CSS</em> and <em>Scratch</em>. This was easy for me as I already had a base knowledge. When the next Summer came, I started taking CCP classes at  <strong>Sincalir Community College</strong>. The first course that I took was CIS 1111 <em>C++</em> programming language. It was simmilar to <em>Python</em>, but the syntax was more complex. I successfully finished that course too.
            </p>

            <p>In my Junior year of high school, I am now taking CIS1350 <em>HTML&CSS</em> Web Development. This class in depth taught me web development, and I realized how much content there is in web development. </p>
